# Sooo, what is react?

Well, it's that thing we are going to use to build what you see, but lets define and describe the "thing".

Simply put, it's a library for creating user interfaces as the react.org states. That's great but why it even exists?
What benefits it has?

Nowadays you can build a webapp using countless different methods and libraries/frameworks. The choice is yours, my
preferred method is using react. I'm not going to do comparison here, you can find that yourself if it's what you are
looking for. If you find react favourable for you then this tutorial will help you to understand and work with it
better (I hope so). For those of you with little to none knowledge of react, these first few pages are for you. We are
going to work trough all necesary concepts that will allow you to build applications like this.

When I'm building something there is one rule I like to stick to as much as I can.  
Make it self-explanatory and simple.  
What I mean by this, firstly lets take overall project structure (this is the way your project is organized).  
Let's say you are building a larger app within a team of few people, and you just hired a new junior coder.  
This person probably doesn't have a lot of experience with larger apps.  
The goal here is to onboard him on the project as fast as possible,  
the project structure should be repetitive across all app parts. When you want to add a new functionality you shouldn't
think too much where to put it.  
Next thing is code itself, if its possible the code should be simple to the point it's self-explanatory.  
By saiying this I'm not saying that you shouldn't comment your code, please do.  
What I mean is, when you are coding some simple feature your code shouldn't be overfly-complicated.  
Simple things don't need comments, complex do.

What this has to do with react? One word, components.
