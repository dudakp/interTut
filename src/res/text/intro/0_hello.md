# Hello developer,

I’m glad that you want to learn something new and decided to click the button. So to the point, how to build this thing
you are looking at. Only requirement to learn how to do this basic programming skills and will to learn.

On the welcome page was a list of technologies used to build this website/app, we will introduce them as we go. So you
dont have to worry if you dont know what lets say, styled-components are or SSR, everything will be explained.

Way this tutorial works is that you will be always presented with part of functioning application that you are free (and
encouraged) to explore and when you are done exploring you can click LEARN button that will take you to the tutorial
part for that part of app. You cannot access parts of application that you didn’t read tutorial for (and hopefully
implemented).

This page is only part of the app that will not be implemented. So lets pretend that this page does not exists end start
learning by clicking HERE.
